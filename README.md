# Taking React for a spin

I had a goal of learning React during easter, as well as getting my ES6 and npm skills up to date. This is basically the outcome of that.

## Setup

* React &amp; flux
* ES6 /w babel &amp; browserify
* Stylus for css

## What is it?

Basically a small app that (as a freelancer) lets you register time spend working for clients. It doesn't actually save anything to anywhere, and there's currently no way to add or remove clients, so it's rather useless as a an actual tool.
